721,negative,the film is flat .
722,negative,the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable .
723,negative,it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
724,negative,"an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity ."
725,negative,the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ?

757,negative,apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
758,negative,the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
759,negative,director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .
760,negative, . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .
761,negative,never comes together as a coherent whole .
762,negative,an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode .

769,negative,"bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made ."
770,negative,"the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults ."
771,negative,less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .
772,negative,a film that suffers because of its many excesses .

778,negative, . . . stale and uninspired .
779,negative,a dreary movie .
780,negative,"instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ?"
781,negative,it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) .
782,negative,mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens .
783,negative,"no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable ."
784,negative,"blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling ."
785,negative,boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon .

827,negative,"if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride ."
828,negative,"the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed ."

832,negative,"as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on ."
833,negative,the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .
834,negative,"there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance ."

841,negative,both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told .
842,negative,"other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst ."

847,negative,"wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '"
848,negative,it's one long bore .
849,negative,it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through .
850,negative, . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .

859,negative,a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
860,negative,a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
861,negative,it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .
862,negative,completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
863,negative,an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories .

866,negative,"the only thing to fear about "" fear dot com "" is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film ."
867,negative,it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
868,negative,"'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree ."

872,negative,"doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez ."
873,negative,"it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the filmit was the unfulfilling , incongruous , "" wait a second , did i miss something ? "" ending ."

893,negative,"i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him ."
894,negative,"it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure ."

927,negative,"stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about ."
928,negative,"it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it ."
